# Currency exchange scrapper for USD and DOP

This is a simple nodeJS project that extracts the buy and sell values for exchanging dop to usd from Dominican Republic Bank Pages.

It runs a web server with a cron job that gets the exchange rates every 1 hour

In case anyone is asking themselves about the **legality** of scrapping data, [here's a link](https://thenextweb.com/security/2019/09/10/us-court-says-scraping-a-site-without-permission-isnt-illegal/) that talks about the legality of scrapping.
